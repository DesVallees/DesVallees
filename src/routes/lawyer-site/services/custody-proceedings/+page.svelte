        <h2>Navigating Custody Proceedings in the United States</h2>
        <p>Custody proceedings involve determining the legal and physical custody of children during and after divorce or separation. At LegalCollab, our experienced legal team understands the sensitivity of custody matters and is dedicated to guiding you through each step of the process.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Types of Custody</h2>
        <p>Custody arrangements can involve legal custody, physical custody, or a combination of both. Legal custody grants a parent the right to make decisions regarding the child's upbringing, while physical custody determines where the child will live.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Best Interests of the Child</h2>
        <p>U.S. courts prioritize the best interests of the child when determining custody arrangements. Factors considered include the child's age, physical and mental health, the ability of each parent to provide a stable environment, and the child's relationship with each parent.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Types of Custody Arrangements</h2>
        <p>Common custody arrangements include sole custody, joint legal custody, joint physical custody, and visitation rights. The court aims to create a plan that ensures the child has a meaningful relationship with both parents whenever possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Custody Modification</h2>
        <p>Circumstances may change after a custody order is established. In such cases, either parent can petition the court for a custody modification. Valid reasons for modification may include a change in the parent's living situation, job relocation, or the child's preference, depending on their age.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>Many custody disputes can be resolved through mediation or alternative dispute resolution (ADR) processes. These methods aim to facilitate communication between parents and help them reach a mutually agreeable custody arrangement without the need for a court trial.</p>
